# Films and Genres Dashboard

Welcome to the Films and Genres Dashboard repository! ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¥

In the digital realm, my project 'Films and Genres' came to life. This journey, crafted within the discipline of 'Web Applications 2', is not just about what I've learned but an adventure filled with innovative ideas.

Utilizing Node.js, Express, React, and PostgreSQL, I merged these components to craft an online space dedicated to movies and genres.

### Key Highlights:

- **Film Management:** Add, list, edit, and delete movies, titles, synopses, and genres.
- **Cinematic Genres:** Create, modify, and remove movie categories, the foundation for organizing our collection.
- **Rigorous Validation:** Ensuring each film contains title, genre, and synopsis.

### Built With:

- **Frontend:** React.js, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

This project isn't just a showcase of skills but a commitment to providing practical solutions for the challenges in the digital landscape.
